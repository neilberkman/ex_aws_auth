  `AWSAuth.sign_url(access_key, secret_key, http_method, url, region, service, headers)`

  `access_key`: Your AWS Access key

  `secret_key`: Your AWS secret key

  `http_method`: "GET","POST","PUT","DELETE", etc

  `url`: The AWS url you want to sign

  `region`: The AWS name for the region you want to access (i.e. us-east-1). Check [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) for the region names

  `service`: The AWS service you are trying to access (i.e. s3). Check the url above for names as well.

  `headers` (optional. defaults to `Map.new`): The headers that will be used in the request. Used for signing the request.
  For signing, host is the only one required unless using any other x-amx-* headers.
  If host is present here, it will override using the host in the url to attempt signing.
  If only the host is needed, then you don't have to supply it and the host from the url will be used.
